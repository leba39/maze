/*
The maze solver implementation goes in this file.

However, there is a special rule:  you are not allowed to directly access
or modify any of the elements of any struct you create.  In other words,
the following code is against the rules:

struct location *x = create_location(5, 5);
x.row = 6;

Your algorithm must make use only of the functions you have written in
your *.c files.
